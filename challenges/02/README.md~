### STEPS

Create namespace and switch to it, 

```
kubectl apply -f  challenge02
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=challenge02
``` 

Create the following objects in that sequence, 

  * Service Account 
  * Cluster Role 
  * Cluster Role Binding 
  * Stateful Set 
  * Storage Class 
  * PersistentVolumeClaim 

You are going to face issues while doing so. Make things work as you start creating these objects.. 

You need to know the following, 
  - Managing pods
  - Statefulsets
  - RBAC 
     - Service Accounts 
     - Cluster Roles and Roles 
     - Cluster Role Bindings 
  - Persistent Volumes 
     - Storage Classes
     - PV and PVC
